# Spoti-safe: Spotify Playlist Backup Platform

## Project Description
Spoti-safe is a lightweight and easy-to-use web application that allows Spotify users to back up their playlists by exporting the details of each track to a CSV file. This application leverages the Spotify Web API to retrieve and save playlist information such as artist name, album, and track title. The project is built using the Flask web framework and Authlib for Spotify authentication and is designed for users who want to keep a local copy of their playlists for data analysis or archiving.

## Key Features
- **Playlist Data Retrieval**: Fetches the details (track name, artist, and album) of any public or private playlist by using the Spotify Web API.
- **CSV Export**: Converts playlist data into a CSV format, allowing users to download a backup of their playlist.
- **Web Interface**: A minimalistic and user-friendly web interface for selecting playlists and downloading CSV files.
- **OAuth Integration**: Uses OAuth for secure authentication with Spotify, supporting access to both public and private playlists.

## Project Structure
- **`server.py`**: Contains the main Flask application code, routing, and server logic.
- **`spotify_api.py`**: Includes the helper functions for interacting with the Spotify Web API, such as fetching playlists and saving data to CSV.
- **`templates/index.html`**: The homepage template for the web application, allowing users to input a playlist ID and initiate data retrieval.
- **`client_credentials.py`**: (Not included) Should include the logic for securely handling Spotify client credentials and access tokens.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Spotify Developer Account (for creating a new application and obtaining `client_id` and `client_secret`)
- Flask (`pip install flask`)
- Authlib (`pip install authlib`)

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/Spoti-safe.git
    cd Spoti-safe
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure Spotify API credentials:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:

     ```
     CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
     CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
     REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/callback
     ```

4. **Run the Flask server:**

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

5. **Access the application** by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage
1. **Get Spotify Playlist ID**: Navigate to any playlist in Spotify, click on "Share," and copy the playlist ID from the URL.
2. **Input the Playlist ID**: Enter the playlist ID in the web application and hit the "Get Playlist" button.
3. **Download Playlist as CSV**: Once the playlist details are fetched, click on "Download CSV" to save a local copy of the playlist data.

## Example Output
The CSV file will have the following structure:

| Artist       | Album         | Track Name         |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Coldplay     | Parachutes    | Yellow             |
| Tame Impala  | Currents      | The Less I Know... |
| Radiohead    | OK Computer   | Karma Police       |

## Future Enhancements
- **Playlist Comparison**: Compare two or more playlists to identify duplicate or missing tracks.
- **Automated Backups**: Implement automated backups for specified playlists at regular intervals.
- **Extended Data Retrieval**: Include additional fields such as track duration, popularity, and release date.
